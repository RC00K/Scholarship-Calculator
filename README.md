# Scholarship-Calculator
VueJS project that will calculate the value of a scholarship based of the users ACT/SAT Score and GPA

# Bugs
Some of the bugs mostly happening when doing the calculation. It's supposed to be able to have the user choose what type of student they are and depending on the student type it will give the option to have the act/sat and gpa slider for first year, and only the gpa slider for transfers. But I can't figure out why it only work when all the sliders have been given a value, and I can only use the button when it has been clicked when on the first year student form. Then it only display when you go back to the transfer form.

There is also an issue for giving the correct awards and information, right know it is only giving back transfer student awards.
